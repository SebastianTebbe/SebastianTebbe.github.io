To identify peer effects, I use a shift-share IV design that links the timing of peers` leasing contract renewals with their estimated probability of adopting an electric vehicle. I study three types of peer groups; co-workers, family members, and neighbors. One new electric vehicle causes, in the next quarter, an additional .077 new electric vehicle acquisitions in the workplace, .014 in the family, and .111 in the neighborhood. This is not due to intertemporal substitution of future planned purchases but reflects a persistent increase in demand for electric vehicles. The peer-driven adoption of electric vehicles largely crowds out demand for diesel and petrol vehicles. The observed peer effects are aligned with an information transmission mechanism about leasing a new electric vehicle. Finally, I document how the empirical findings can inform the design of optimal environmental policies in the presence of peer effects.","tags":null,"title":"Peer Effects in Electric Car Adoption: Evidence from Sweden","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Teevrat Garg","Ryan Hanna","Jeffrey Myers","Sebastian Tebbe","David Victor"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738540800,"objectID":"b2f9d89018b5d3ac808a7b48151702e6","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/charging-infrastructure/","publishdate":"2023-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/charging-infrastructure/","section":"publication","summary":"To minimize the environmental impact of electric vehicles (EVs) and support decarbonizing electric grids, drivers must charge their EVs when renewable energy generation is abundant. To induce a shift in charging behavior toward daylight hours with abundant solar energy, we conducted a field experiment (n = 629) at a large university campus to measure the influence of informational and financial incentives on the usage and timing of workplace charging. While neither intervention affected total charging, they induced opposite temporal shifts. Receiving information about the climate benefits of daytime charging induced a transition from early to later morning, whereas receiving larger financial incentives to charge on campus prompted a shift from daytime to overnight and early morning charging. We identify high network utilization as a possible mechanism that causes increased competition for chargers and earlier arrival times during the financial discount period. The results show substantial heterogeneity among subgroups in temporal shifts, with those having high flexibility to change daily schedules (e.g., students, residents) primarily shifting the timing of their charging. Our findings highlight the importance of informational nudges, network capacity, and driver demographics for crafting sustainable charging policies.","tags":null,"title":"Electric Vehicle Charging at the Workplace: Experimental Evidence on Incentives and Environmental Nudges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Myers","Ryan Hanna","Teevrat Garg","Josh Kavanagh","Jan Kleissl","Sebastian Tebbe","David Victor","Byron Washom"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735862400,"objectID":"e14b048661ea7d666b3c6213b87f213c","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/planning-model/","publishdate":"2024-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/planning-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Many workplaces and other institutions are grappling with how to plan and deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging networks to support their employees and other constituents who drive EVs. We develop a novel approach for designing EV charging networks that is driver-centric: it estimates drivers' charging needs based on their driving and charging habits and determines the optimal number and type of chargers to install to meet those needs. Unlike prior literature, our framework establishes a unique individual profile for each driver based on their observed behaviors and habits. We demonstrate our approach at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) EV network of 439 charging ports using behavioral data derived from 800 EV drivers. We find that using unique driver profiles significantly increases expected network usage and size—in some cases requiring fivefold more workplace charging sessions and a threefold larger network compared to the same analysis based on regionally-averaged driver data. These increases are driven by drivers' tendency to recharge with high battery state-of-charge, which increases network size by 50 alone and implies less value in using high-power chargers. An institution's goals for supporting drivers, which are important for equity, also significantly affect network size.","tags":null,"title":"Design of workplace and destination-based EV charging networks considering driver behavior, habits, and preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Nilsson","Matthew Tarduno","Sebastian Tebbe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1712102400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712102400,"objectID":"8e907f8abc0c43e0b224c7e70cfe27cb","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/road-pricing/","publishdate":"2024-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/road-pricing/","section":"publication","summary":"We provide a framework for setting congestion charges that reflect emission and congestion externalities and policy responses, such as vehicle ownership, driving, and residential sorting. Using Swedish administrative microdata, we identify these responses by exploiting a temporary exemption for alternative fuel vehicles and variation in individuals’ exposure to congestion charges. We find that commuters respond by adopting exempted alternative fuel vehicles, shifting trips away from fossil fuel toward alternative fuel vehicles, and changing where they live and work. We combine the estimated responses with the framework to recover an optimal congestion charge of €9.46 per crossing in Stockholm.","tags":null,"title":"Road Pricing with Green Vehicle Exemptions: Theory and Evidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manja Gärtner","Robert Östling","Sebastian Tebbe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"1adbe94d5d0fef716a2cecd9eedfac84","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/journal-of-economic-science-association-2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-of-economic-science-association-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Players often fail to coordinate on the efficient equilibrium in laboratory weak-link coordination games. In this paper, we investigate whether such coordination failures can be mitigated by increasing the number of rounds or altering per-period stakes. We find that neither time horizon nor stakes affect equilibrium selection. In contrast to previous findings, players are not more likely to play above the previous period’s minimum choice when the horizon is longer or per-period stakes lower. We also investigate which socio-demographic factors and behavioral traits correlate most strongly with play both in the first round and in subsequent rounds. Cognitive ability as measured by a cognitive reflection test stands out as the characteristic that is most strongly associated with efficient coordination.","tags":null,"title":"Do we all coordinate in the long run?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
