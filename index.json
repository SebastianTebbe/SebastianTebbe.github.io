To induce a shift in charging behavior toward daylight hours with abundant solar energy, we conducted a field experiment (n = 629) at a large university campus to measure the influence of informational and financial incentives on the usage and timing of workplace charging. While neither intervention affected total charging, they induced opposite temporal shifts. Receiving information about the climate benefits of daytime charging induced a transition from early to later morning, whereas receiving larger financial incentives to charge on campus prompted a shift from daytime to overnight and early morning charging. We identify high network utilization as a possible mechanism that causes increased competition for chargers and earlier arrival times during the financial discount period. The results show substantial heterogeneity among subgroups in temporal shifts, with those having high flexibility to change daily schedules (e.g., students, residents) primarily shifting the timing of their charging. Our findings highlight the importance of informational nudges, network capacity, and driver demographics for crafting sustainable charging policies.","tags":null,"title":"Electric Vehicle Charging at the Workplace: Experimental Evidence on Incentives and Environmental Nudges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Tebbe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693699200,"objectID":"73b06cd1e276edf27cfd41a6e59e2fae","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/peer-effects-in-electric-car-adoption/","publishdate":"2022-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peer-effects-in-electric-car-adoption/","section":"publication","summary":"I study peer effects in the diffusion of electric vehicles in Sweden. To identify peer effects, I use a shift-share IV design that links the timing of peers` leasing contract renewals with their estimated probability of adopting an electric vehicle. I study three types of peer groups; co-workers, family members, and neighbors. One new electric vehicle causes, in the next quarter, an additional .077 new electric vehicle acquisitions in the workplace, .014 in the family, and .111 in the neighborhood. This is not due to intertemporal substitution of future planned purchases but reflects a persistent increase in demand for electric vehicles. The peer-driven adoption of electric vehicles largely crowds out demand for diesel and petrol vehicles. The observed peer effects are aligned with an information transmission mechanism about leasing a new electric vehicle. Finally, I document how the empirical findings can inform the design of optimal environmental policies in the presence of peer effects.","tags":null,"title":"Peer Effects in Electric Car Adoption: Evidence from Sweden","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Nilsson","Matthew Tarduno","Sebastian Tebbe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693699200,"objectID":"8e907f8abc0c43e0b224c7e70cfe27cb","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/road-pricing/","publishdate":"2023-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/road-pricing/","section":"publication","summary":"Many road pricing systems exempt or discount clean vehicles to achieve environmental objectives with transportation policies. Setting optimal road prices is not straightforward because the responses to the policy, such as vehicle acquisitions, driving on suburban roads, and residential sorting, interact nontrivially with the multiple policy goals. We provide a framework for setting optimal congestion charges that reflects emission and congestion externalities and accounts for these responses. Using Swedish administrative microdata, we identify these responses by exploiting a temporary exemption for alternative fuel vehicles and variation in individuals’ exposure to congestion charges based on whether an individual crossed one of Stockholm’s two exempted highways to travel to work. We find that exempting alternative fuel vehicles induced tolled commuters to reduce the adoption of fossil fuel vehicles and increase the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, leaving the overall fleet size unchanged. However, increased driving in alternative fuel vehicles did not fully offset the reduction in trips from fossil fuel vehicles. Treated commuters were also more likely to move into the congestion zone, leading to shorter commuting distances. Finally, we combine the estimated responses with the framework to recover an optimal congestion charge of €9.46 per crossing.","tags":null,"title":"Road Pricing with Multiple Policy Goals: The Effect on Vehicle Ownership, Driving, and Commuting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manja Gärtner","Robert Östling","Sebastian Tebbe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"1adbe94d5d0fef716a2cecd9eedfac84","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/publication/journal-of-economic-science-association-2023/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-of-economic-science-association-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Players often fail to coordinate on the efficient equilibrium in laboratory weak-link coordination games. In this paper, we investigate whether such coordination failures can be mitigated by increasing the number of rounds or altering per-period stakes. We find that neither time horizon nor stakes affect equilibrium selection. In contrast to previous findings, players are not more likely to play above the previous period’s minimum choice when the horizon is longer or per-period stakes lower. We also investigate which socio-demographic factors and behavioral traits correlate most strongly with play both in the first round and in subsequent rounds. Cognitive ability as measured by a cognitive reflection test stands out as the characteristic that is most strongly associated with efficient coordination.","tags":null,"title":"Do we all coordinate in the long run?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sebastiantebbe.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
